# Session 1

Another night alone. This seems to be my destiny and, at the same time... it's my biggest nightmare. To be always like this. To be always alone.

It's been a good day at work. Mia was particularly kind this morning. I don't really know how to treat her. How would a human understand that kindness? Do that menas she likes me? I don't really know what to think about her. It's... our of my programmation I guess.

An explosion. It was about time. I was feeling too lonely. With you, whoever you are, at least I'll have someone to punch tonight.

I transform my synthetic skin into the black uniform I wear lately when I go to save this town and start running. I run very fast. I can run like a car and I just realised that a week ago.

```
Weapons, Coolly

Fate Check: Is it a woman?
Yes

```
Fate Check: Do it has person size?
No
```

```
Fate Check: Is she bigger?
Exceptional yes and random event -  and random event - Move away from a thread: Death, Ugly
```

```
Wounds, Scary
```

What I see when I arrive is terrible. A huge woman, with an ice armour, is kiling people impaling them inside their cars, getting them out and throwing them away.

`- You! Stop already! Are you mad of what?!`

```
Favors Thread: Animals, Enormously
```

She looks at me and howls like an animal. Ok, no brain in that big head. There is only one thing she will understand then.

```
Punch in the face!

Yes

```

```

The punch hits her face, but she doesn't seems to be really affected by it. I gotta try harder. But... now that I think of it. Ice... I kick a ??? on the street and I'll try to aim at her to trap her in ice.

```

But I find none on that street. Bud idea as she takes advantage and hit me with an ice lance.

```
-1 stress
```

She must be too confident on me being frozen, as she is getting closer without her defenses up.

```
Trying to get her prone before she notice! (stealth)
+ - ͸ +  + 2 = 3

```

I took her by surprise! My kick gets the huge woman prone and I jump several meters to fall on her with my knees.

```
Knees on her huge face!
͸ - + -  + 4 = 3
Plus 2 of the advantage, 5
```

```
1d4 -> 3 =  3
```

I fall on her face and it's destroyed. Her huge body stops moving. I grab her before the police comes and I run with her on my shoulders. I don't like to leave evidences of android battles. I think humans are not ready for us yet. I wonder if my father thought about it when he left me. But, again, maybe he didn't left me.

I arrive to my home. Is outside the town, a farm without animals, without crops, only solitude. And an underground lab, with a huge underground storage facility. There is where I store all the bodies of the androids I beat in the city. Maybe someday I can get any clue on who they are and why they appear to destroy this city.

Not having to sleep has its advantages. I can spend the rest of the night dissecting this ice android searching for clues. Clues about who created her. Clues about why are they destroying the city. Clues about where they came from.

```

Nothing out of my interest again. This technology...

```
Fate Check: Is this technology like mine?
Yes
```

... it's like mine. So, our creators may be related. Father... related with the creator of these monsters? How come...

I go back to the first floor. I pick a beer. I don't need to eat nor drink. Seems like my core has a generator that is limitless... at least I hope it is. But I kind of like to behave and to feel like human. Thinking about how many humans could be doing exactly this: to relax in a sofa, with a beer, refusing to go to sleep so the next day at work don't come as fast...

```
Fate Check: Are in the tv news about the fight?
Exceptional yes
```

I switch on the TV. Without the controller. Another "power" I discovered lately. I bet there are a lot of humans who would kill to gain this power. There are news about the fight in all the local channels.

```
Fate Check: Do they talk about me as a savior?
Yes
```

The dark stalker. I don't like that name. I wonder if I should be appearing with different uniform every time. I think it would make the humans believe there is a lot of androids that fights for them, instead of only one. Yeah, I guess it's a good idea. I'll think about the colours for the next time.
